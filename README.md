# Multibrot Set Animator
I revisited an [old project](https://github.com/Amenhotep314/Fractals) and dug a little deeper into the Multibrot set. I implemented a Complex class to handle basic complex number operations, since Java doesn't offer native support for this. Most of the fractal generation code is algorithmically similar to the Python I wrote many years ago, but I've included many speedups and optimizations.

To play around with this code, grab a [Jave Runtime Environment](https://openjdk.org/install/) and be warned! Running it made my computer quite toasty for quite a while.
